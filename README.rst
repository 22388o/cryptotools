About this repo
---------------

Barebones Python 3.6+ implementation (no dependencies) of some common cryptographic functions for educational purposes.
Feel free to fork the repo and play around with it. Performance is ..abysmal but otherwise it works fine. Please do not
use this for anything serious because I am not a security expert.


Examples
--------

from ECDS.secp256k1 import generate_keypair
from btctools import pubkey_to_address
